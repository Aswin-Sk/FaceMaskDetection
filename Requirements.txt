Face Mask Detection Using Computer Vision


Our team's central objective is to create a robust machine-learning model capable of confidently discerning whether a person is wearing a mask or not. This endeavor involves training a face mask detection model leveraging MobileNetV2 as our base model. To accomplish this mission we have chosen to harness the capabilities of the Keras deep learning library ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in model development and training. 

This project is a face mask detection system using the MobileNetV2 deep learning model and Flask for the web interface. It can classify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not.

Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the project:

-os
-numpy
-matplotlib
-keras
-imutils
-scikit-learn
-Flask
You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install os numpy matplotlib keras imutils scikit-learn Flask


Running the application

steps:
git clone https://github.com/Aswin-Sk/FaceMaskDetection.git
cd FaceMaskDetection
python app.py
http://localhost:5000
The model is already present inside mask.model. If you want to retrain the model you can make nescessary modifications to main.py and run it.
